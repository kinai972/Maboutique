# MaBoutique

This is a project about a e-shop with user and product management using Symfony framework and Bootstrap.

This is my first "big" symfony project that I do by myself.

It obviously not over yet but the design is almost complete (bootstrap) and users can register and login.

## Installation 
1. Download the project
2. open it with your code editor
3. Change the database information in the .env file (DATABASE_URL section) 
4. Run "composer install" in your console
5. Create the database (symfony console do:da:cr)
6. Update the database (symfony console do:sc:up --force)
